insertJs
========

In-page script that allows you to insert extra .js and .css files into a header and footer before document ready.

This script is ment to be used where new scripts need to be inserted into a website but there is no premission to edit the header or footer templates.
It is also designed to override any default versions of scripts (i.e. if site using jQuery1.3 it can override it with jQuery1.4+).

To be able to use it you simply need access to the content area (html) and upload files to the file structure (/images, /js etc.)

There are variables in the main insert.js that allows you to add and check for elements.

Code and source to be available shortly.
